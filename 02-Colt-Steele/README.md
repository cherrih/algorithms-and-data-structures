# Big O Notation

### Linear O(n)

As n increases, runtime increases proportionately with n

### Constant O(1)

Runtime will be the same no matter the size of n
- Arithmetic operations are constant
- Variable assignment is constant
- Accessing elements in an array (by index) or an object (by key) is constant

### Quadratic O(n^2)

As n increases, runtime increases at a rate of n^2

### Logarithmic O(log n)
