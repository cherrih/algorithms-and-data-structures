# Big O Notation

## Runtime Complexity

#### Linear O(n)

As n increases, runtime increases proportionately with n

#### Constant O(1)

Runtime will be the same no matter the size of n
- Arithmetic operations are constant
- Variable assignment is constant
- Accessing elements in an array (by index) or an object (by key) is constant

#### Quadratic O(n^2)

As n increases, runtime increases at a rate of n^2

#### Logarithmic O(log n)

## Space Complexity

#### Constant
- Most primitives (booleans, numbers, undefined, null)

#### Linear
- Strings (where n is string length)
- References (where n is the length for arrays or the number of keys for objects)
